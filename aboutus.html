    <div class="aboutusdiv">
      <p class="parabout">Insider's Insight was founded in 2022 by a group of interns who found that the work life is not really what it seems. We were all a part of a company that was not professional, not realiable, and not even properly maintained. We saw that this internship was not our niche and we could no longer work in an environment that was unethical for many. As interns, we did not receive any tasks to do, received meetings to join without any heads up, and even no response from the owner of the company. We confronted the owner and what happened next will shock you, we got removed from the position and the groupchat. We were claimed to be distractions to the company. This was the last straw for many and we began our journey here. </p>
     <br>
     <p class="parabout">At that time, we saw that we were all disgruntled but we had a passion, a passion to build. All of our Team Members have a variety of skills; from Software Development, Web Development, Marketing, HR/PR Skills, to Social Media. We're a talented group and what was the smartest thing to do? Combine. We combined all of our skills to create Insider's Insight. No one was discouraged, all motivated. There was a lot of communication to develop this site let alone the company. This is what we all needed, a honest workplace with true tasks.</p>
     <br>
     <p class="parabout">Insider's Insight is a brand for the people by the people. We know that the work life is not what it seems, it's not as easy as many portray it to be. Insider's Insight provides honest and quick responses to our clients. We make our clients feel as if they are part of the team. We're on a mission to make businesses grow, brands become billionaires, and build a future for us all.</p>
