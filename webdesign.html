            <h2>We are Insider's Insight</h2>
            <p>We create, develop, test, and produce digital websites for a wide range of clients that help them innovate, build, and flourish. But most importantly, it's your brand and we are here to listen and learn. We are object orientated and identify all targets before we proceed. We then use our skillset to make your digital dream come alive.  </p>

            <ul>
                <li>1. Make a rough draft. Use the original method of notetaking, pen and paper.</li>
                <li>2. Send the rough draft to the client and the client will then send feedback.</li>
                <li>3. Begin the process of development and design. We use Microsoft Visual Studio.</li>
                <li>4. Every day, two pages will be completed and sent to the client for more feedback.</li>
                <li>5. Have a meeting on Friday with the client, for updates, concerns, and changes.</li>
                <li>6. Once the website is complete, send all files, passwords, and information to the client.</li>

              <h2>Can you make us a new website?</h2>
              <p>Definitely. There is no website that we cannot make. Although we are a small company now, our web developers are highly experienced in creating landing pages, sample pages, reactive websites, and company websites. We can build you anything and we'll make sure to give you our complete insight. </p>

              <h2>How long does it take to make a website?</h2>
              <p>That question is completely dependent on the client. If the client needs a website done instantly, our web design team will immediately be dispatched and reach out every day for updates. If there is no rush, our web designers will begin with gathering all information, brainstorming, and begin developing! It's not only our design but your idea, and we pledge to make it perfect, </p>
